Installation
------------

1. Introduction

The suPHP Apache module together with suPHP itself provides an easy way to
run PHP scripts with different users on the same server.

It provides security, because the PHP scripts are not run with the rights of
the webserver's user.
In addition to that you probably won't have to use PHP's "safe mode", which
applies many restrictions on the scripts.

Please note that the suPHP binary have to be installed setuid-root to work,
so a security bug in suPHP probably will allow atackers to run commands with
root privileges. Although I currently don't know any bug in suPHP I can't
guarantee that there aren't any.

2. Installation

Modify config.h to match your needs.

Now compile suPHP using "make" and if no error occured install it using
"make install". Be sure to be root, when you try to install it.

Now you have to add the setuid-root-bit to the executable. Do so by using
"chmod u+s /usr/sbin/suphp".

Now you have to compile Apache with mod_suphp. See apache/INSTALL for
information on this.
