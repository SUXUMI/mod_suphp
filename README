What is it?
-----------

The suPHP project combines an Apache handler module and a setuid
binary. Together, they allow PHP scripts to safely run as the script
owner rather than the Apache webserver user.

suPHP validates that the requested PHP script has appropriate ownership
and permissions. It also verifies that the filesystem paths leading to
the PHP script have safe ownership and permissions.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation for mod_suphp is available in the "doc" directory.

The "doc/INSTALL" file details the installation process of mod_suphp.

The "doc/CONFIG" file contains instructions for configuring the setuid
suphp binary.

The "doc/apache/CONFIG" file contains instructions for configuring
the mod_suphp Apache handler module.
