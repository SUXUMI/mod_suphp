Installation
------------

1. Introduction

The suPHP Apache module together with suPHP itself provides an easy way to
run PHP scripts with different users on the same server.

It provides security, because the PHP scripts are not run with the rights of
the webserver's user.
In addition to that you probably won't have to use PHP's "safe mode", which
applies many restrictions on the scripts.

Please be sure to have read the README file in this directory and both the
README and the INSTALL file in the main directory of the suPHP distribution.


2. The simple facts

In this part, I'll give the most important information for people who know
how to compile the Apache Server with additional modules.
If you aren't familiar with doing this, you'll find a step-by-step guide in
the third part of this manual.

mod_suphp only consists of one file, called "mod_suphp.c".
If the suphp binary is not in the default path (/usr/sbin/suphp) you'll have
to modify the corresponding line in mod_suphp.c before adding it to your
Apache sources with the "configure" script of Apache.
 
You should be able to compile mod_suphp as a dynamically loadable module
(DSO), although I haven't tested it.

Please note that mod_suphp was developped for Apache 1.3.22 and perhaps
won't work with other Versions (especially Apache 2.x).

suPHP was developped for Linux, perhaps it'll also work with some other
*NIX-systems.
If you have tested it with another system and it works, please tell me.


3. Step-by-step guide

I. Apache sources

Get the Apache sources from http://www.apache.org and unpack them.
Now go into the newly created directory. And run "./configure --help" which
will output some really useful information about the configure-script.

Now run the configure script with the parameters that match your needs but
add the option "--add-module=/path/to/mod_suphp.c".

This will copy mod_suphp.c to the Apache sources and activate it.

Now you can "make" Apache and install it using "make install".

Please note that suPHP will not work if you also compile in mod_php.

To use suPHP to parse PHP-Files the only thing you have to is to add a Line
like

AddHandler x-httpd-php .php

to your Apache configuration.
